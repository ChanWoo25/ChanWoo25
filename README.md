👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; **About Me**

I graduated with a major in electrical engineering from Soongsil University. \
Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree under the guidance of Professor Jun-Won Choi \
in the Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence (SPA) Lab at Hanyang University.

My main interest lies at a development of Robust SLAM System by utilizing recent sensor fusion-based studies. \
The application that motivates me the most is autonomous driving of various robots. \
I am a sociable person, but also very calm. I enjoy gathering people together to learn something, \
and I enjoy thinking about and applying how to collaborate better with people. \
I strongly believe that we learn everything from failures.
